# Python-Portfolio
Semester 1 Final (and other things)

#Project 1: MadLibs
#This first project is a MadLibs simulator. The code asks for various user inputs, then sticks 'em all together into a funny story. This code is unique because I worked hard to properly string all the inputs together into a 
#story that made sense. I used different functions to make sure all the words had the same capitalztion, ect.

#Project 2: PokemonChallenge
#This second project is my most complex. I uploaded images that represented each stage of my Pokemon. Then, I created an interactive game that allowed users to train, battle, rest, and compete in a final boss round. I chose
#this code because it took mutiple days and a whole lot of hard work. It was my first time using a "while True" loop and having mutiple input options.

#Project 3: RockPaperScissors
#For this code, I used an assortment of features. I used a random number generator, which decided either rock, paper, or scissors. Whoever plays the code will battle the computer in a simple game, will then learn their score/standing, and whether they won or lost against the commuter. Like the PokemonChallenge, I made the code continous using "while True".

#Project 4: SpiritAnimalGenerator
#This code was my first time taking mutiple inputs. Similar to the PokemonChallenge, this project spanned mutiple days- making it extra difficult to keep track of my work and making sure everything ran smoothly. I set up different paths for the users based on their input, which eventually led them to their Spirt Animal. I used "if", "elif", and named variables to ensure my code ran smoothly

#Project 5: MultiplicationQuiz
#This quiz is my most recent, and most impressive, project. This is by far my favorite, due to the complexity and effort I put in to complete it. I imported a timer so when the player finished their quiz, which might be my favorite feature. I also used a "while True" loop to make it continous, created 3 levels of questions, and allowed the users to pick their desired number of questions. This was my first time putting a variable I collected from the user into a loop, which was a super cool feature!

#In conclusion, I am very proud of all the work I've put into this semester. I have learned so many new skills, and continued growing expontially throughout the school year. I am very greatful for all of the things I've learned this semester and cannot wait to contuine to learn and grow as a coder.
